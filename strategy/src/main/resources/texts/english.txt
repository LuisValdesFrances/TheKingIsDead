War is the art of destroying men, politics is the art of deceiving them.
After the war, peace; of peace, abundance; of abundance, vice; of vice, war.
War is a great effort of all towards peace.
Kill them all, God will already recognize theirs.
The two most powerful warriors are patience and time.
I have come a long way from the battlefield to the peace table.
Damn man of letters!.
